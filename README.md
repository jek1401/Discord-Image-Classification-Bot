My project aims to create an easy-to-use AI system that automatically recognizes different types of fruits and reports their calorie content. The idea is that users can easily determine what kind offruit it 
is and how many calories it—Åontains by simply uploading a photo of it. The project aims to make the process of obtaining information about fruits quick and accessible, and to help users
make informed decisions about their diet.
